## Description
This is a simple app that serves as the back-end API for a social network site. Built from scratch, it makes use of [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) for all of the routing, [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for its database, the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) ODM to connect the database to the Express server, and [Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) to format dates and timestamps. Users will be able to use this API through [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) to post and update their thoughts, view and react to others' thoughts, add and delete friends, as well as add and delete thoughts and users.
